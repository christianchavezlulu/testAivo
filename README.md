# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Moviex

The Moviex is a web application that allows users to browse and discover a collection of movies and TV series. It provides an intuitive interface for filtering and sorting movies based on various criteria, such as genre, release year, and popularity. Users can explore details of each movie, including its title, description, and poster art.

## Features

- Browse and search movies and TV series
- Filter movies by type (movie or series)
- Sort movies by name or release year
- User authentication with login and logout functionality
- User profiles with personalized information

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Material-UI: UI component library for React
- Auth0: Authentication and authorization platform
- React testing library: Unit testing of the component

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- NPM (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-catalog.git


2. Install the dependencies: 
- cd movie-catalog
- npm install


3. Start the development server:
- npm start


4. Open the application in your browser:
- http://localhost:3000


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
